# Smart-Fire-Alert-System
Detect the smoke and fire location. 
This device is combined with three basic sensors, smoke sensor, GPS sensor and SD card module. The Microcontroller is Arduino and the Processor is Raspberry Pi 3 model B. The data I collect from sensors will be sent to Raspberry pi and then Raspberry Pi will send this data to AWS server.  My main responsibility is the hardware part and data collection.
